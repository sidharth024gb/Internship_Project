          <p className="aboutpara ind">
            More than 35 years ago, after a trip to Europe, Ray Berry and his
            wife Beverly were inspired to bring the charm and essence of an
            open, European-style food market to America. They envisioned a more
            intimate and personalized shopping experience than the
            warehouse-type supermarkets popular at the time. Leaving his job
            overseeing 3,600 7-Eleven stores, the Berry family poured their life
            savings into their dream: creating a warm and inviting shopping
            experience filled with the freshest produce, hand-trimmed meats,
            fresh-cut flowers, and the finest foods and ingredients from around
            the world. In 1982, the first Freshmart store opened in Greensboro,
            North Carolina, on Lawndale Drive. This 14,000-square-foot boutique
            specialty grocery store differentiated itself from conventional
            supermarkets with a farmerâ€™s market atmosphere. It featured
            locally-grown produce, bins of freshly roasted coffee, an old-world
            style butcher shop, a fish market, an in-store bakery, fresh
            cheeses, cured meats, and floral stands. The original store became
            the blueprint for other locations to follow.
